# GeoSpatialClustering

The idea of this project is to analyse and cluster locations of a driver and tag them as home, work and secondary work and non work locations. This analysis will enable us to understand the driver behaviour and work patterns thereby, optimizing work hours and pointing out anomalous behaviour. The data used is arbitrary and the GPS coordinates are randomly sampled from NYC taxi trajectory dataset. The data used is also uploaded in the repo. The project is written in an object oriented way with Python; while the map visualizations are done with the help of a python library called 'Folium'. The advantage with this library is that we do not need shape files as with some other geolocation based libraries. The end result for this data set is a set of clustered data points plotted on maps with the help of algorithms like KMeans, DBscan and deep learning based self organizing maps (SOM). The evaluation metrics and conclusion is included as well.
